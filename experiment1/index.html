				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Click to see more patterns.</p>
				<p>Got inspired by the idea of a the golden ratio and it's essence of being perfect. I wanted to give a shot at recreating it with p5.js as vector art.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>First I created my canvas with colors I  wanted.</p>
				<p>Then I had to add the golden ratio into code with (1 + Math.sqrt(5)) /2</p>
				<p>I started making the first square then adding the curve into the square. This part was not very difficult.</p>
				<p>Next I try making a for loop to conitnue the pattern, however, I was unable to make a loop that continously put each square and curve into the right position.</p>
				<p>I still used a for loop but add variables to move the squares and curves into the correct positions without manually making each square.</p>
				<p>Once I finished the golden ration, I went through messing around changing all kinds of variables and the way the code was setup to create new patterns that still held that essence of the golden ratio.</p>
				<P>Personally my favorite is the second variation. I feel like it looks most like the golden ratio, just with a solid bit of flair.</P>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I'm sure theres a better way to recreate the golden ratio, and that my codes not perfect, but I'm really happy that I was able to complete this project.</p>
				<p>I did get a bit discouraged in the middle when I had much trouble getting the squares and curves to be in there correct position and almost changed the end objective of my project.</p>
				<p>Continuing on and making new pattersn was also super fun and cool to see exactly what would be made.</p>
				<p>In the end I'm real happy with what I created and learned.</p>
