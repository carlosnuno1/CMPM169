				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Wanted to totally revamp the visualizer I made in experiment 3. Changed the input from mic input to chrome tab input allowing for spotify and youtube anything that gives audio.</p>
				<p>That was the biggest thing I wanted to fix from that original project.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Added some sdk chrome tab api stuff to share a tab, screen, program, to use as input which took a bit of fiddling but it works very well.</p>
				<p>Also added a couple more shapes, as well as changing the shapes directly correlating to their own frequencies volume rather than entire audio volume on a mutiplier.</p>
				<p>These two changes make a huge inpact ont he quality of the visualizer, and I'm super happy with how it came out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Super happy I came back and changed the stuff that I feel wasn't very quality from the original project. This was a passion project to the max and I'm just so happy with how it turned out.</p>
				<p>THeres still some issues but there will not never not be issues so I'll probably end up leaving it after this.</p>
				<p>I hope whoever sees this project thinks it's as cool as I think it is.</p>
				<p>IF THE AUDIO DOESN'T WORK AFTER CLICKING SHARE, CLOSE THE WHOLE TAB AND OPEN YOUR AUDIO TAB BEFORE OPENING THE PROJECT TAB.</p>
