				<h2> Description</h2>
				<p>To use the vizualizer, first open up any audio source you want from your computer. I find it works best using the chrome tab with the spotify web player/dedicated music streaming platform, but any audio source will work.<p>
				<p>I would set the volume of the audio source to about 65% for best results, but different platforms perform differently and some songs work better with different volumes so play around with it.</p>
				<p>Next click the start audio button on the right, click the tab or screen, AND MAKE SURE SHARE AUDIO IS ON. Then play your audio and the vizualizer should start.</p>
				<p>I find music that has a lot of seperated instrumentals, and lots of back and forth loud and quiet stuff looks pretty cool. Most electronic music especially dance music, looks pretty cool. But explore try different stuff see what you like.</p>
				<p>I think most stuff from Ecco2k looks quite cool on it, especially AAA powerline. JPEGMAFIA stuff looks pretty nice as well. Check it out. By all means check out how the music you like looks on it.</p>
				<p>The vizualizer will have a slight delay to the audio, so if you want it to sync a bit better, right click the tab you're playing audio from and mute the site, then click the unmute button the right side.</p>
				<p>.</p>
				<p>IF IT DODESN'T WORK READ THIS.</p>
				<p>If you refresh the page, it will stop working so if this happens, or it just doesn't work for some reason, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click the home link, then click experiment 4 again.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Wanted to totally revamp the visualizer I made in experiment 3. Changed the input from mic input to chrome tab input allowing for spotify and youtube anything that gives audio.</p>
				<p>That was the biggest thing I wanted to fix from that original project.</p>
				<p>Added some sdk tab api stuff to share a tab, screen, program, to use as input which took a bit of fiddling but it works very well.</p>
				<p>Also added a couple more shapes, as well as changing the shapes directly correlating to their own frequencies volume rather than entire audio volume on a mutiplier.</p>
				<p>These two changes make a huge inpact ont he quality of the visualizer, and I'm super happy with how it came out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Super happy I came back and changed the stuff that I feel wasn't very quality from the original project. This was a passion project to the max and I'm just so happy with how it turned out.</p>
				<p>Theres still some issues but there will not never not be issues so I'll probably end up leaving it after this.</p>
				<p>I hope whoever sees this project thinks it's as cool as I think it is.</p>
