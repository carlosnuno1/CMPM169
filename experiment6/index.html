				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project is a haiku poem generator using with it's wordbank being comprised of all the lyrics from the ablum Errorzone by Vein.fm.</p>
				<p>Click for more poems.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Each word in the wordbank is given a syllable count and catorgirzed by type of word(noun, verb, adjective, etc.)</p>
				<p>The the algorithm that choose the words for the poem has weights for type of words and and strict rules for syllable count to create more coherent poems while staying within the haiku structure.</p>
				<p>It's far from perfect, but it helps to create a more intersting and undertsandble poem with some kind of message behind it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall I'm pretty happy with the end result of the project. Not the most technically impressive, or most creative project, but it was fun making it and a learned a solid bit from making it.</p>
